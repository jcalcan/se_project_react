**Tech used**

This project was fun and challenging. React was used for the responsive design along with css display grid. React hooks were maximized to increase loading and performance. Bandwith, server strain, mobile performance are all taken into account when designing the app.

**Description and Functionality**
WTWW is a site that provides suggestions based on the local weather conditions. You can upload garments of any type as a "digital closet' to help you save time choosing what to wear daily. The site is designed to function on any browser- mobile or desktop. No need to install special extensions. Plans to improve the project includes user database management, archiving garments feature, adding location services to determine user location.

**Images and screenshots**
Photo showcase of the design of the site in different dimensions for various devices. For example,
for mobile devices it would look like this - ![mobile](./src/assets/mobile_screenshot.jpg). For tablets like this ![tablets](./src/assets/tablet_screenshot.jpg) and regular desktops like this ![desktop](./src/assets/desktop_screenshot.jpg). The design and code were made with React and intuitive to users devices in mind. Easy to use, read and navigate were top priority elevating the users experience with the app.

Good luck and have fun!
